My own mount for radiator for watercooling

Standart radiator for 120mm fan

Also i have added remixed fan guard, so you can easily use 'VzBot-like' guard in your design.

And cutouts for nylon ties to fix your tube

Splitter can be found [here](https://aliexpress.ru/item/1005004807850181.html), SY30 3 Way 5 Port is used in design, should be enough. But you can choose bigger splitter, but you are able to mount it on 2 screws instead of 4

Take attention, that these splitters has G1/4 as top thread, while on sides G1/2 thread is. So fittings and end cap should be suitable
